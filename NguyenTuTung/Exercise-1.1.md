#  1.1 What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizerâ€™s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?

## Level 2 to level 3:
..* The thinking that leads to Level 3 testing starts with the realization that testing can show the presence, but not the absence, of failures. which mean that everytime we use software, we incur some risk.
... In level 3 testing, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk
## Level 3 to level 4:
..* Level 4 thinking defines testing as a mental discipline that increases quality. Various ways exist to increase quality, of which creating tests that cause the software to fail is only one.
... level 4 testing means that the purpose of testing is to improve the ability of the developers to produce high-quality software.
