Exercise 1.3: What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk?
Can we reduce the risk to zero?
- Risk refers to the probability of loss. We cannot totally eliminate risk, thus the goal of testing is to reduce it.
However, testing is still necessary to find and eliminate flaws not only during development but also throughout the product life cycle.
