Topic: Give a one-to-two paragraph explanation for how the inheritance hierarchy can affect controllability
and observability.

Answer: Controllability is impacted by inheritance hierarchy because we must control every superclass and its subclasses, 
which is difficult to do with a deep inheritance tree. On the other side, it has an impact on observability
because we must observe a huge number of subclasses that perform the same function as the superclass.
