#1.1 What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizerâ€™s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?   
---
* Level 2 to level 3:

	* The thinking that leads to Level 3 testing starts with the realization that testing can show the presence, but not the absence, of failures. It means that everytime we use software, we incur some risk.
	* In level 3 testing, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk

* Level 3 to level 4:

	* Level 4 thinking defines testing as a mental discipline that increases quality. There are many ways to increase quality, of which creating tests that cause the software to fail is only one.
	* The purpose of level 4 testing is to improve the ability of the developers to produce high-quality software.
