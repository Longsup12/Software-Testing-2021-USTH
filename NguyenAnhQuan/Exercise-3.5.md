The test onlys checks the first element in the list. It leads to limited reachability. The test doesn't pay enough attention the infection and propagation. For instance, if the third and fourth elements are not sorted, the test wouldn't detect and reveal the fault. To ensure the RIPR model, we should assert for all elements with sort() method.
