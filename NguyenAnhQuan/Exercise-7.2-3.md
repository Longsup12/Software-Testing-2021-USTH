d)
This question has multiple possible answers. Either t1 or t3 can be used to directly tour a path that satisfies all-defs for the def at node 0, and either t4 or t5 can be used to directly tour a path that satisfies all-defs for the def at node 3.
Possible answers: {t1, t4} or {t1, t5} or {t3, t4} or {t3, t5}
e)
This question only has one possible answer: {t1, t3, t5}
f)
This question only has one possible answer: {t1, t3, t4, t5}
