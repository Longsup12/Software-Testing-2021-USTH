a) Yes. T1 necessarily satisfy C2 as this follows directly from the definition of subsumtion.
b) No. T2 doesn't necessarily satisfy C1 as there is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2.
c) No. Testers think that test sets for strong criteria are at least as good at finding faults as test sets for weaker crieria. There is no requirement that T2 will be an subset of T1. So, it is possiable that T2 may contain one test that reveals the fault, and T1 doesn't reveal any fault.
