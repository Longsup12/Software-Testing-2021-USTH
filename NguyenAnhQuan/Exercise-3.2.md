Inheritance hierachy increases the complexity of the program and also lowers observability and controllability.
The factors of inheritance hierachy that affect the metrics are:
* It can hide data including variables of a class which can't be accessible to outside.
* Overridden and Overloaded methods.
* Polymorphic changes of the program during the runtime.
