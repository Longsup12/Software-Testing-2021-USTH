Question: What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Bezierâ€™s testing level 2
(testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?

Answers:

- Anticipate and predict possibilities: the more prepared the software,the more likely it is to have a coherent cture to
  produce better quality.
- Good architecture and design: a consistent architecture and principles create a solid foundation for software reduces
  effort, time, and money.
- Defect measurement: use the software as if it were your customer! Build software reports, you can spot rs and use that
  information to quickly fix them!
- Good unit tests: the main outputs, inputs, and tools are key. This gives testers more time and power.
