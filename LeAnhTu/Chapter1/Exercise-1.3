Exercise 1.3: What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we
reduce the risk to zero?

Answer:

- The possibility of loss is also known as risk. We cannot completely control the risk this means that the purpose of
  testing is to reduce the risk but testing is still essential to help detect and suppress bugs not only in the
  development stages but also throughout the product life cycle.
