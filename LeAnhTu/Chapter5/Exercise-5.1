Question: Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2. Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies
C1 on program P and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.

a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.

Answer: Yes. Because test criterion C1 subsumes C2 if and only if every set of test cases that satisfies criterion C1
also satisfies C2.

b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.

Answer: No. There is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2.

c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault.

Answer: No. T2 is parent of T1 so T1 maybe do not reach the fault.
