### Topic: Answer the following questions for the method search() at Section 6.1.

<center>Answer</center>

### a) “Location of element in list” fails the disjointness property. Give an example that illustrates this.

Example: input = ([1], 1)

- B1: True
- B2: True
- B3: False

=> Disjointness fail

### b) “Location of element in list” fails the completeness property. Give an example that illustrates this.

Example: input = ([1, 2, 3], 0)

- B1: F
- B2: F
- B3: F

=> Completeness fail

### c) Supply one or more new partitions that capture the intent of “Location of element in list” but do not suffer from completeness or disjointness problems.

Separating the characteristic into 4 blocks below:

- Is element appear at the first position:
    + True
    + False


- Is element appear at the last position:
    + True
    + False


- Is element appear at the others position:
    + True
    + False


- Is element is not in the list:
    + True
    + False
