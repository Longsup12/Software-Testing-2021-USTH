# Exercise 7.4.4 

## Use the following methods trash() and takeOut() to answer
questions aâ€“c.
```java
public void trash (int x) 
{
int m, n; 

     m = 0;
     if (x > 0)
     m = 4;
     if (x > 5)
         n = 3*m;
    else 
        n = 4*m; 
    int o = takeOut (m, n10
    System.out.println ("o is: " + o);
}
public int takeOut (int a, int b)
{
    int d, e;

    d = 42*a;
    if (a > 0)
        e = 2*b+d;
    else
        e = b+d;
    return (e);
}
```
## a) Give all call sites using the line numbers given.
* For variable [m], lines are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12
* For variable [n], lines are 3, 9, 11, 12
## b) Give all pairs of last-defs and first-uses.
* For variable [m], last def is in line 7, first use is in line 9
* For variable [n], last def is in line 11, first use is in line 21
## c) Provide test inputs that satisfy all-coupling-uses.
* x = {0,1,6}
