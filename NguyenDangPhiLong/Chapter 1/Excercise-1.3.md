# Ex 1.3: What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?
* "Risk" means the possibility of failure appearence belongs to a program
* To reduce it by zero depends on the program we work it, as large as the program is, 
as difficult as to reduce the "risk" by zero
