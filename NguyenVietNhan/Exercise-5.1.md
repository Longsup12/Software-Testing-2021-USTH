Ex5.1:

a)-T1 must satisfy C2 according to the strict definition of Criterion Subsumption. -Criteria Subsumption: A test criteria C1 subsumes a test criteria C2 if and only if every set of test cases that fulfill C1 also satisfies C2. b)No, because C2 does not, as stated in the task, subsume C1. c)T2 may have a unique/different test case than T1. In this way, despite the fact that it (the test case) must meet the model, the different/special one reveals the flaw.
